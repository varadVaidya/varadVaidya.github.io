I'm Varad Vaidya, an engineer and an MTech by Research student at the Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems in IISc Bengaluru. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, in 2022.

I previously worked at Thermax Limited, Pune, where I focused on alternate (biomass-based) and renewable energy sources for industrial processes.

My academic interests center around robotics, particularly in the autonomy and control of robots and aerospace vehicles. I'm also intrigued by spacecraft and space robots.

During my time at VNIT, I actively contributed to IvLabs, where I worked on modeling and controlling quadrotors and explored the dynamics of robotic manipulators. I also briefly ventured into mobile robots and applied Deep Reinforcement Learning for robotic control.

Currently, I'm researching the use of onboard inertial guidance for precise maneuvers in aerial robots.

Beyond academics, I have a passion for music and photography. I've achieved "Praveshika Purn" in Hindustani Classical Music and am currently learning to play the Veena. I also enjoy badminton and chess.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss robots, aerospace, or any other shared interests.
